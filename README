RSpec Haml Scaffold Generator
====

This acts just like any other scaffold generator for Rails except it uses RSpec instead of test/unit and HAML instead of erb.

Examples:

  ./script generate scaffold post # no attributes, view will be anemic
  ./script generate scaffold post attribute:string attribute:boolean
